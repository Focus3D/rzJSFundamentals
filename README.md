# rzJSFundamentals
Javascript cheat sheet. 

## Purpose
Something for me to look up more quickly than [Mozilla's Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) docs.

This isn't meant for teaching new material; just to jog your memory when you can't remember something small about any given method.

## Usage
If you have a console in your text editor, feel free to replace the **console.log()** lines with **debug()**.

These was written in [repl.it](http://repl.it). You can copy, paste, and run the scripts from there.

## Contributing
If there are bugs, or better ways to implement these functions, then feel free to fork and submit a pull request. Improvements are welcome.
